# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the Agentical documentation.

## Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names for images
- Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `agent-workflow-diagram.png`)
- Include the image type as a suffix (e.g., `-diagram`, `-screenshot`, `-icon`)

## Image Types

- **SVG**: Preferred format for diagrams and illustrations
- **PNG**: Use for screenshots and images that need transparency
- **JPG**: Use for photographs or when file size is a concern

## Organization

Images are organized in the following subdirectories:

- **architecture/**: System architecture diagrams
- **workflows/**: Workflow pattern illustrations
- **agents/**: Agent-related diagrams
- **tools/**: Tool-related illustrations
- **ui/**: User interface screenshots
- **logos/**: Agentical logos and branding

## Adding New Images

When adding new images:

1. Place them in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Optimize images for web (compress when possible)
3. Add alt text in documentation when referencing images
4. Consider creating both light and dark mode versions for diagrams

## Image Dimensions

- **Diagrams**: 1200×800px (3:2 ratio)
- **Screenshots**: Native resolution, cropped appropriately
- **Icons**: 128×128px (1:1 ratio)
- **Logos**: 600×200px (3:1 ratio)

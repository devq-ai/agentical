# Evaluation in Agentical Framework

## Overview

The `evaluation` directory contains components for systematically assessing the performance and effectiveness of agents, workflows, and the overall Agentical framework. This module enables data-driven improvement of AI systems through structured testing, benchmarking, and reporting.

## Directory Structure

```
evaluation/
├── __init__.py             # Package initialization
├── metrics.py              # Evaluation metrics definitions
├── benchmarks.py           # Benchmark definitions
└── reports.py              # Evaluation reporting utilities
```

## Core Components

### Evaluation Metrics

The `metrics.py` file defines quantitative and qualitative metrics for evaluating agent and workflow performance:

- **Accuracy Metrics**: Measuring correctness of responses
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Measuring resource usage and time
- **Quality Metrics**: Assessing output quality through rubrics
- **Safety Metrics**: Evaluating adherence to safety guidelines
- **Custom Metrics**: Domain-specific evaluation criteria

### Benchmarks

The `benchmarks.py` file contains benchmark definitions for standardized evaluation:

- **Standard Benchmarks**: Pre-defined evaluation scenarios
- **Benchmark Datasets**: Test cases for specific capabilities
- **Benchmark Runners**: Tools for executing benchmarks
- **Comparative Analysis**: Tools for comparing performance

### Evaluation Reports

The `reports.py` file implements reporting utilities for evaluation results:

- **Report Generation**: Create structured reports from evaluation data
- **Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs of results
- **Export Formats**: Support for various export formats (PDF, HTML, etc.)
- **Historical Comparison**: Compare current and past evaluations

## Key Evaluation Approaches

### Agent Evaluation

Methods for evaluating individual agents:

- **Capability Testing**: Evaluate specific capabilities (e.g., text generation, code review)
- **Prompt Robustness**: Assess performance across different prompts
- **Output Validation**: Verify adherence to expected output formats
- **Error Analysis**: Identify common failure modes

### Workflow Evaluation

Methods for evaluating complete workflows:

- **End-to-End Testing**: Evaluate complete workflow execution
- **Agent Interaction Analysis**: Assess how well agents collaborate
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Measure steps required to complete tasks
- **Human Evaluation**: Incorporate human ratings of workflow outputs

### System Evaluation

Methods for evaluating the overall framework:

- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure system throughput and latency
- **Resource Utilization**: Track CPU, memory, and API token usage
- **Scalability Testing**: Assess performance under increasing load
- **Integration Testing**: Verify compatibility with external systems

## Usage Example

```python
from agentical.evaluation import Benchmark, Metrics, Report

# Create a benchmark
benchmark = Benchmark.from_config("code_review_benchmark.yaml")

# Run the benchmark against an agent
results = await benchmark.evaluate(code_review_agent)

# Calculate metrics
metrics = Metrics.calculate(results)

# Generate a report
report = Report.generate(metrics, title="Code Review Agent Evaluation")

# Export the report
await report.export("code_review_evaluation.html")
```

## Evaluation Workflows

The evaluation module supports several evaluation workflows:

1. **Continuous Evaluation**: Automated evaluation on each code change
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare performance of different implementations
3. **Regression Testing**: Ensure new versions maintain quality
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback into evaluation

## Extending the Evaluation Framework

The evaluation framework can be extended in several ways:

1. **Custom Metrics**: Define domain-specific metrics
2. **Specialized Benchmarks**: Create benchmarks for specific use cases
3. **New Report Formats**: Implement additional reporting formats
4. **Integration with External Tools**: Connect with other evaluation platforms

## Best Practices

1. Define clear evaluation criteria before implementation
2. Use a mix of automated and human evaluation
3. Compare against baseline implementations
4. Track evaluation results over time
5. Prioritize improvements based on evaluation insights
6. Document evaluation limitations and assumptions

# Monitoring in Agentical Framework

## Overview

The `monitoring` directory contains components for observability, telemetry, and debugging in the Agentical framework. This module provides tools to track the performance, behavior, and health of agents, workflows, and the overall system in both development and production environments.

## Directory Structure

```
monitoring/
├── __init__.py             # Package initialization
├── logfire.py              # Logfire integration
├── telemetry.py            # OpenTelemetry integration
└── dashboard.py            # Monitoring dashboard
```

## Core Components

### Logfire Integration

The `logfire.py` file implements integration with Pydantic Logfire:

- **Log Collection**: Gather logs from all system components
- **Structured Logging**: Use structured log formats for better analysis
- **Log Enrichment**: Add context to logs for easier debugging
- **Log Transport**: Send logs to Logfire for centralized storage and analysis
- **Log Analysis**: Analyze logs for patterns and anomalies

### OpenTelemetry Integration

The `telemetry.py` file provides OpenTelemetry integration:

- **Metrics Collection**: Gather performance and usage metrics
- **Tracing**: Track request flow through the system
- **Span Management**: Create and manage spans for operations
- **Context Propagation**: Maintain context across async boundaries
- **Exporter Configuration**: Configure exporters for different backends

### Monitoring Dashboard

The `dashboard.py` file implements a monitoring dashboard:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: View system status in real time
- **Agent Performance**: Track agent effectiveness metrics
- **Workflow Visualization**: Visualize workflow execution
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor system resource usage
- **Alerting**: Configure and manage alerts for critical issues

## Monitoring Aspects

### Agent Monitoring

Track agent behavior and performance:

- **Prompt Usage**: Monitor system prompt usage and effectiveness
- **Completion Quality**: Assess the quality of agent responses
- **Tool Usage**: Track which tools agents use and how often
- **Error Rates**: Monitor agent errors and failures
- **Response Times**: Measure agent response latency

### Workflow Monitoring

Track workflow execution and performance:

- **Step Execution**: Monitor each step in workflow execution
- **Agent Interactions**: Track how agents interact in workflows
- **Completion Rates**: Measure workflow completion success
- **Duration Analysis**: Analyze time spent in different workflow stages
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Identify performance bottlenecks

### System Monitoring

Track overall system health and performance:

- **API Performance**: Monitor API endpoint response times
- **Database Performance**: Track database query performance
- **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and storage usage
- **Error Rates**: Track system-wide error rates
- **External Dependencies**: Monitor external service health

## Usage Examples

### Setting Up Monitoring

```python
from agentical.monitoring import setup_monitoring

# Set up monitoring with default configuration
setup_monitoring()

# Or with custom configuration
setup_monitoring(
    logfire_api_key="your-api-key",
    telemetry_endpoint="https://otel-collector.example.com:4317",
    enable_dashboard=True
)
```

### Tracking Agent Performance

```python
from agentical.monitoring import AgentMonitor

# Create an agent monitor
monitor = AgentMonitor(agent_id="research-assistant")

# Track an agent run
with monitor.track_run(query="Research quantum computing"):
    result = await agent.run(query)
    
    # Record specific metrics
    monitor.record_metric("response_quality", 0.92)
    monitor.record_metric("tool_calls", 3)
```

## Integration with Alerting

The monitoring system can trigger alerts based on predefined conditions:

- **Threshold Alerts**: Trigger when metrics cross thresholds
- **Anomaly Detection**: Alert on unusual patterns
- **Error Rate Alerts**: Notify when error rates increase
- **Latency Alerts**: Alert on performance degradation
- **Custom Alerts**: Define domain-specific alert conditions

## Visualization Options

The monitoring system offers several visualization options:

- **Web Dashboard**: Interactive web-based monitoring dashboard
- **Grafana Integration**: Connect to Grafana for custom dashboards
- **Real-time Charts**: Live updates of key metrics
- **Historical Trends**: View metric changes over time
- **Workflow Graphs**: Visualize workflow execution paths

## Best Practices

1. Enable comprehensive monitoring in production environments
2. Set up alerts for critical metrics
3. Regularly review monitoring data for insights
4. Use structured logging for better searchability
5. Balance monitoring detail with performance impact
6. Retain monitoring data for trend analysis
7. Document monitoring metrics and their significance

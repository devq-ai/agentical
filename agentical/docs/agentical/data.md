# Data in Agentical Framework

## Overview

The `data` directory contains resources, datasets, and storage for the Agentical framework. Unlike the source code directories, this is where persistent data, model files, configuration resources, and runtime storage are maintained. The data directory is designed to be separate from the code to facilitate backups, version control, and deployment strategies.

## Directory Structure

```
data/
├── knowledge/               # Knowledge base data
│   ├── schemas/             # SurrealDB schemas
│   ├── seeds/               # Seed data
│   ├── embeddings/          # Embedding model files
│   └── backups/             # Database backups
└── ...
```

## Core Components

### Knowledge Base Data

The `knowledge/` directory stores data related to the knowledge base:

- **Schemas**: SurrealDB schema definitions and migrations
- **Seeds**: Initial data for populating the knowledge base
- **Embeddings**: Model files for generating vector embeddings
- **Backups**: Regular backups of the knowledge base

### Configuration Files

Common configuration files stored in the data directory:

- **Environment-specific Configurations**: Settings for different environments
- **Secrets**: Encrypted or secure configuration (when not using environment variables)
- **Templates**: Template files for generating content
- **Schemas**: JSON schemas for validation

### Cache Data

Runtime caches to improve performance:

- **Embedding Cache**: Cached embeddings for frequently used content
- **Response Cache**: Cached responses for common queries
- **Model Cache**: Cached model predictions or generations
- **API Response Cache**: Cached results from external APIs

### Training Data

Data used for fine-tuning or training models:

- **Fine-tuning Datasets**: Data for fine-tuning LLMs
- **Evaluation Datasets**: Datasets for evaluating agent performance
- **Synthetic Data**: Generated data for testing and training
- **Annotated Data**: Human-annotated data for supervised learning

## Data Management

### Persistence Strategy

Data in this directory is managed with several considerations:

- **Version Control**: Some data files may be version controlled
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups for critical data
- **Migration Path**: Procedures for upgrading data schemas
- **Retention Policy**: Guidelines for data retention and cleanup

### Environment Separation

The data directory supports different environments:

- **Development**: Local data for development
- **Testing**: Test data that's reset between test runs
- **Staging**: Representative data for pre-production testing
- **Production**: Live production data

## Best Practices

1. Keep sensitive data encrypted or use environment variables instead
2. Establish clear backup procedures for critical data
3. Document the purpose and structure of data files
4. Use seed data for repeatable setup of development environments
5. Include data validation as part of the CI/CD pipeline
6. Implement data migration scripts for schema changes
7. Monitor storage usage and implement cleanup policies

## Integration Points

### Knowledge Base Connection

The knowledge base connects to data in this directory:

- SurrealDB connects to schemas and seed data
- Embedding models are loaded from the embeddings directory
- Backup and restore operations use the backups directory

### Configuration Loading

Configuration files are loaded at runtime:

- Environment-specific configuration overrides defaults
- Templates are loaded for content generation
- Schemas are used for validation

## Related Components

- **Knowledge Base**: Uses data from this directory
- **Agents**: May use cached data for improved performance
- **Workflows**: Might reference templates stored here
- **Evaluation**: Uses datasets from this directory for testing

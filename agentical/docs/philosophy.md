## Introduction

devq.ai is a project built on an agentic framework using Pydantic AI, enhanced with several custom operations. The core motivation stems from the team’s shared experience: AI can be effectively deployed to solve specific, finite problems under the supervision of a real human. This isn’t revolutionary, nor does it contradict large-scale AGI efforts—it’s simply a practical approach to solving real problems, saving time, and creating opportunities for people.

## Speed vs Focus

How do we focus AI? By providing context, rules, tools, and a method for reasoning. Doing this well requires human expertise. We can only trust AI if we can validate its outputs. For example, I can’t ask an AI how to land a plane because I don’t know how to fly one. Ask a pilot, and they’ll respond with, “What are the conditions? What kind of plane?”—and probably a hundred more questions. Then they can give a reasonable answer. I wouldn’t even know which questions to ask. Context comes from the expert who knows what matters.

Rules help narrow the problem space by defining how we want the problem to be solved—whether it’s a high-level architectural framework or coding styles that reflect personal preferences. Tools, ranging from applications to MCP servers, take on some of the heavy lifting. Standardized tools also improve repeatability and, ultimately, trust in the results.

Reasoning is often conflated with spending more time, but because LLMs are fundamentally probabilistic, that doesn’t guarantee better answers—except in edge cases. That’s why we’ve added a structured method for reasoning, which may be our most distinct (and controversial) feature. We’ve built a tool—accessible via MCP server and API—that applies Bayesian inference and generates probability estimates.

We believe this approach creates more effective agents for solving the specific problems that matter to you.
